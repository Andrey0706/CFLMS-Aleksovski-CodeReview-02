		<div class="articleContent">
			<p>Wild theories of sabotage still persist two weeks after a mysterious pressure leak occurred on the International Space Station, and the gossip has gotten so nonsensical that both NASA and Russia’s state space corporation, Roscosmos, are now trying to quell the rumors.

In a joint statement released today, NASA and Roscosmos claim that the US space agency is working closely with Russia to figure out the cause of the leak. The statement also notes that no information will be released until the Russian-led investigation is over, despite rampant speculation in the Russian press that the leak was possibly caused by one of NASA’s astronauts in space.

During a teleconference yesterday, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine and Roscosmos general director Dmitry Rogozin “affirmed the necessity of further close interaction between NASA and Roscosmos technical teams in identifying and eliminating cause of the leak, as well as continuation of normal ISS operations and NASA’s ongoing support of the Roscosmos-led Soyuz investigation,” according to the statement. “They acknowledged the entire crew is dedicated to the safe operation of the station and all docked spacecraft to ensure mission success.”

NASA and Roscosmos first detected a drop in the space station’s pressure around 7PM ET on Wednesday, August 29th, suspecting that there was a leak of some kind on the ISS. The air was escaping at such a slow rate, though, that flight controllers opted not to wake the crew. The next day, the six astronauts on board the ISS traced the leak to a small hole inside one of the two Russian Soyuz capsules docked to the space station — the vehicles used to bring crew to and from Earth. This particular Soyuz has been at the ISS since June 8th, and the hole was found in one of the modules that is jettisoned before the Soyuz enters Earth’s atmosphere during its descent. So the piece is not necessary for the entire trip back to the ground.</p>

		<div class="articleContent">
			<p>Creatives and news publishers will be empowered to negotiate with internet giants thanks to new copyright rules which also contain safeguards on freedom of expression.

MEPs adopted the directive in plenary by 348 votes in favour, 274 against and 36 abstentions. This marks the end of the legislative process for the European Parliament that began in 2016. It will now be down to member states to approve Parliament’s decision in the coming weeks. If the member states accept the text adopted by the European Parliament, it will take effect after publication in the official journal and then member states will have 2 years to implement it.

The directive aims to ensure that the longstanding rights and obligations of copyright law also apply to the internet. YouTube, Facebook and Google News are some of the internet household names that will be most directly affected by this legislation.

The directive also strives to ensure that the internet remains a space for freedom of expression.

A press conference with the rapporteur Axel Voss and MEPs Helga Trupel and Sajjad Karim will be held at 15.00 and can be viewed here.

Tech giants to share revenue with artists and journalists

The directive aims to enhance rights holders’ chances, notably musicians, performers and script authors, (creatives) as well as news publishers, to negotiate better remuneration deals for the use of their works when these feature on internet platforms. It does this by making internet platforms directly liable for content uploaded to their site and by automatically giving the right to news publishers to negotiate deals on behalf of its journalists for news stories used by news aggregators.

		<div class="articleContent">
			<p>Amazon chief Jeff Bezos is launching a $2bn fund to help homeless families and build a network of preschools, saying the “child will be the customer” in his philanthropy announcement.

The tech founder and the world’s richest man unveiled the Bezos Day One Fund on Thursday. He said he would fund existing organizations that aid homeless people and pledged to build new not-for-profit schools to serve low-income communities.

“We’ll use the same set of principles that have driven Amazon. Most important among those will be genuine, intense customer obsession,” he wrote on Twitter. “The child will be the customer.”/p>

		<div class="articleContent">
			<p>Polar announced two new workout trackers today: the more expensive Vantage V and the cheaper Vantage M companion. Let’s start with the bigger, more expensive watch. The Vantage V costs $499.90 and includes a new optical heart rate sensor with nine LEDs along two different wavelengths (green and red). This, the company says, should make its heart rate readings more accurate.

The biggest addition to the watch is its power measurements for running. This is a relatively new metric, but you might recognize it because of products like Stryd. It essentially measures a wearer’s work output, similar to how cyclists measure their watts generated. Runners likely will appreciate this for training purposes. It doesn’t support LTE, although it does have a built-in GPS. It charges over a custom charger and should last for 40 hours of sports activity time, Polar says. It’s also water and swim-proof. The watch features a 1.2-inch, 240 x 240 touchscreen that’ll turn off once wearers enter their workout mode. It’s available in white, black, and orange.

The cheaper Vantage M costs $279.90 and features a lot of the same technology, except for the touchscreen and running power detection. Unlike on the Vantage V, you can actually change the bands on the Vantage M. The watch also doesn’t include one of Polar’s signature software features, “recovery mode,” which analyzes wearers’ previous workouts to determine how long they’ll need to recover. Both watches are available for preorder today through Polar’s website and will ship in October.</p>

		<div class="articleContent">
			<p>Elon Musk has smoked marijuana live on the internet while appearing on the Joe Rogan Experience web show. The embattled Tesla billionaire took a pull on a huge joint during the course of an interview that lasted over two hours. He also swigged whisky from a tumbler. At the time of writing, Musk had just wrapped up the explosive interview which included discussion on love, artificial intelligence, the state of the human race and his own feelings as head of Tesla and private space company SpaceX. It follows a tumultuous few weeks where he doubled down on baseless claims that British driver Vernon Unsworth was a paedophile. Elon Musk takes a drag on a spliff during his appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience During the course of a rambling discussion, Rogan asked Musk about his state of mind and the constant swirl of ideas that leads to him ‘inventing so many things.’ Musk responded that his brain is constantly filled with thoughts and that he can’t seem to get away from them. He called it a ‘mutation’. Asked when he first became aware he was ‘different from other people’, the Tesla boss said he was about five or six years old. ‘At first I thought I was insane,’ he told the host. He also says he ignores the vast majority of negative comments that come his way on the internet. When quizzed on his use of Twitter to engage with people, Musk said his behaviour on Twitter was ‘on balance, more good than bad. But there’s definitely some bad. So, hopefully the good outweighs the bad.’ ‘There’s a lot of negativity on Twitter,’ Musk added. Earlier on in the interview, Musk referred to social networks like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook as ‘giant cybernetic collectives’. But, when referring to his own experiences, he explained that most of the time he is unaffected. ‘The vast majority of negative comments, I just ignore them. Every now and again I get drawn in and it’s not good, you can make some mistakes,’ he said

		<div class="articleName"><p id="sixth">Edward Snowden surveillance powers ruled unlawful</p></div>
		<div class="articleContent">
			<p>The UK's bulk interception powers, exposed by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, have been found to be illegal by the European Court of Human Rights.

In a landmark judgement, the court ruled agencies had violated rights as there were no proper safeguards.

The court crucially said bulk interception was legitimate and it had seen no evidence it had been abused.

Parliament reformed surveillance powers in 2016 and introduced a new watchdog. Critics say the system is still flawed.

What were the powers being challenged in court?
In 2013, Edward Snowden revealed that GCHQ - the UK's eavesdropping agency - had been secretly collecting communications sent over the internet on an industrial scale.

It could reassemble the communications, filter them and then analyse the remainder for anything useful to protecting national security.

Bulk surveillance programmes revealed:

"Tempora" - the bulk storage of all internet traffic GCHQ could harvest
"Karma Police" - an attempt to catalogue the web habits of any user who could be found
"Black Hole" - a digital library of more than one trillion internet "events"
The agency could also obtain data and content from its US partners and companies including Apple, Google and Facebook.

Campaigners argued that these collection systems violated the right to privacy - and on Thursday the European Court of Human Rights agreed.

What did the court say?
The judgement said the system revealed by Mr Snowden simply did not have any proper safeguards because it led to completely "untargeted" collection of information.

In practice, this meant personal information could be seen by GCHQ, even if it had nothing to do with national security threats.

The judgement said: "While there is no evidence to suggest that the intelligence services are abusing their powers - on the contrary, the [then British watchdog] observed that the selection procedure was carefully and conscientiously undertaken by analysts, the court is not persuaded that the safeguards governing selection of bearers [internet cables] for interception and the selection of intercepted material for examination are sufficiently robust to provide adequate guarantees against abuse.

"Of greatest concern, however, is the absence of robust independent oversight of the selectors and search criteria used to filter intercepted communications."

		<div class="articleName"><p id="seventh">How to preorder the iPhone XR</p></div>
		<div class="articleContent">
			<p>Preordering is necessary if you want to receive your new iPhone on launch day. Those who opt out of preordering may be lucky enough to find a new model at a local carrier retail store shortly after launch, though it’s more likely that you may be without one for as long as a few days or weeks.

If you’re set on preordering, get your iPhone ready to trade in, and be prepared to stay up late — no matter where you are in the US.

APPLE
Boot up the Apple Store app on your iPhone this Friday, October 19th at 12:01AM PT / 3:01AM ET to be among the first to place your order.

If you have an iPhone X, you can get up to $525 in credit toward your purchase through Apple’s GiveBack trade-in program. Even trading in an iPhone 7 can knock $200 off of your final purchase price.

The 64GB XR model is $749, or $37.41 per month for 24 months with Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program. For a XR with 128GB of storage, the outright cost is $799, or $39.50 per month. At the top of the pricing spectrum, the 256GB model costs $899 all at once, or $43.66 per month for 24 months through Apple’s financing.

Keep in mind that an unlocked version isn’t currently offered, and Apple will force you to choose a carrier at checkout.

T-MOBILE
Preorders for T-Mobile customers begin online at 12:01AM PT / 3:01AM ET on Friday, October 19th. The iPhone XR will be eligible for T-Mobile’s new 36-month plan that will reduce how much you pay each month.

SPRINT
Sprint will open up preorders for the XR on Friday, October 19th. But if you don’t want to stay up late, its Priority Status will let you save a spot in the queue.

AT&T
If you’re on AT&T’s network, preorders will begin on Friday, starting at 12AM PT / 3AM ET. You can purchase the XR for $749.99 outright, or pay $25 per month for 30 months.

U.S. CELLULAR
You’ll be able to preorder from U.S. Cellular starting on October 19th at 12:01AM PT / 3:01AM ET. It won’t offer special promotions for trade-ins, but it’s still a good shot to secure the XR before launch day arrives.

VERIZON
Preorders at Verizon begin at 12:01AM PT / 3:01AM ET on October 19th. The 64GB model costs $749.99 outright, and if monthly payments is what you’re after, it will cost $31.24 per month for 24 months. Even paying $37.49 monthly for the 256GB version will bring you within a dollar of its cost outright.

In terms of special offers, Verizon is knocking 25 percent off of iPhone XR cases until the phone’s release on 10/26.

SAM’S CLUB
Preorders begin at Sam’s Club at 12:01AM PT / 3:01AM ET on Friday, October 19th. If you preorder the XR and activate it upon its October 26th release for Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, or T-Mobile, you’ll receive a $100 Sam’s Club gift card.

WALMART
If you preorder and activate the XR at Walmart through Verizon, AT&T, or Sprint, you’ll receive $100 back in savings. You can reserve a phone on Walmart’s website, though you’ll need to head to your local store to take advantage of this deal.

Are you curious how the iPhone XR stacks up to the iPhone XS and XS Max? We’ve compared each and every spec so that the buying decision is a bit easier.</p>

		<div class="articleName"><p id="eight">This smart power strip lets you individually control each outlet</p></div>
		<div class="articleContent">
			<p>There are an endless number of smart plugs that let you remotely turn an outlet on and off, but those plugs usually accept just one single cable. So to address bigger needs, Kasa is introducing an entire smart power strip that allows you to individually control all six of its power sockets.

The Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Power Strip has six power sockets, which can be controlled through an app or by voice assistants, as well as three USB ports that always remain powered on. Kasa, which comes from the router company TP-Link, is far from the first to make a smart power strip, but it is perhaps the first major brand to do so. And given that, when it comes to power strips, you really want to buy from a legitimate brand, that makes this announcement a notable one.

On top of that, Kasa’s line of smart home products actually work, and its app is fairly easy to use. Once you have the power strip set up, you’ll be able to assign different icons to each socket, so that you can identify what’s plugged into them — be it a computer, a fan, a lamp, or something else. The app also integrates with Alexa, the Google Assistant, and Cortana, so you can control the sockets by voice. Kasa says that it’s working on HomeKit support as well but doesn’t have a date for when it’ll be ready.

The strip’s three USB ports can’t be turned off, which seems fine since those are probably going to be charging gadgets or else sitting unused. Unfortunately, the ports max out at 4 amps, which means they won’t be able to fast charge any smartphones, which is really what you’d want to use them for. I’m sure some USB ports could still come in handy for other purposes, but I suspect anyone who’s nerdy enough to buy this product will also be the kind of person who wants to use a power adapter that supports fast charging, which is going to take up a socket.

Another benefit here is that the whole thing connects to your home network over Wi-Fi, so you don’t need some other hub or smart speaker in order to start using it. I have a couple of smart plugs in my home (both from Kasa) so I very much understand the use for them, but I do have to wonder: how many people will need to remotely control more than one or two things connected to the same power strip? I’m not sure who has that many lamps, fans, and other objects that would benefit from remote control in the exact same place.</p>

		<div class="articleName"><p id="ninth">OnePlus announces super cheap USB-C earbuds</p></div>
		<div class="articleContent">
			<p>Finally! OnePlus has just announced the product that so many Android phone users have been crying out for for many months: cheap, yet high-quality USB-C earphones to replace the analog ones we can no longer use with our phones that are deprived of headphone jacks.

The new OnePlus Type-C Bullets are an upgraded version of the very good Bullets Wireless that I reviewed back in 2016. The Bullets v2 were priced at $19.99, and OnePlus promises to keep the price unchanged with its new USB-C edition, while adding a few design and feature updates. The Type-C Bullets will come with a built-in Cirrus Logic DAC, which should make them compatible with most USB-C devices, including laptops and tablets. They’ll also have a built-in microphone and remote control.

OnePlus says it’ll release the new Bullets at the same time as its next flagship, which we already know will be called the OnePlus 6T and will feature a fingerprint reader built into the display. The specific timing of the release hasn’t yet been announced, but if OnePlus keeps to its traditional calendar, both the OnePlus 6T and the Type-C Bullets should be available to buy sometime this November, if not sooner.</p>

		<div class="articleName"><p id="tenth">Spotify raises limit for offline downloads to 10,000 songs per device</p></div>
		<div class="articleContent">
			<p>Spotify is improving of one of its most annoying, arbitrary limits. The music streaming app has increased the cap for maximum number of offline downloads, which was previously stuck at 3,333 songs per device (on a maximum of three devices).

As reported by Rolling Stone, that limit has now been raised to 10,000 songs — and you can download that many tunes on five different devices instead of just three. So you’re looking at 50,000 in all. “At Spotify, we’re always working on improving the experience for our users,” a company spokesperson told Rolling Stone.

Unfortunately, Spotify’s other annoying ceiling — a 10,000 track limit on your personal library — remains very much in place. That’s really the one I keep running into. Once you hit it, you’ve constantly got to pluck out albums or artists you’re not listening to regularly. Hopefully the bump up in offline downloads is a sign that Spotify might soon also raise the maximum library size, as well. I can save 50,000 songs to a handful of devices, but I’m unable to have those same songs in my library? Doesn’t make a ton of sense. Please fix.</p>
